# nordWAR: a Local Baseball Analysis Project

WAR analysis plus extras for non-MLB townball leagues. The vast majority of these calculations come from FanGraphs, who have dutifully written down most of the math they work with to calculate fWAR. The bad news is that townball leagues frequently don't count as many statistics as the MLB does; frankly, we're lucky to be able to extrapolate as far as I do here.

If you are solely looking for the stats and output, [the PDF](https://github.com/BSSDRVN/nordWAR/blob/main/tcmabl.pdf) is what you're after. The bulk of the value for me is on page 5 (Two-League Babycake WARs), but if you are interested in league-by-league statistics for my baseball team, feel free to browse around.
